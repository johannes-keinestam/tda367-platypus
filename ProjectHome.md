## What is PlatyPix? ##
PlatyPix is a cross-platform batch image editor written in Java application. It specialized in editing large quantities of images, using pre-defined or custom filters.

## Why do I want PlatyPix? ##
PlatyPix is very easy to use. It can be used as an easier alternative to Photoshop and other advanced image editors when you want to quickly apply filters to a large set of images.

It is also very extendable. Custom filters can be downloaded and effortlessly imported into PlatyPix. If you know Java, making your own filters is a cinch.
